# Executing Multi-Template ALPACA (MALPACA) 
This tutorial contains instructions for executing mult-template ALPACA (MALPACA) to accomodate large morphological disparity within a sample. MALPACA is essentially running multiple ALPACA, each of which based on a single template, then extract the median estimates. Therefore, the same settings of ALPACA apply to MALPACA. For tutorials of how to run ALPACA and , please refer to: https://github.com/SlicerMorph/Tutorials/blob/main/ALPACA/README.md. 

Download sample data here: https://github.com/SlicerMorph/mouse_models. Extract the files. If you are using SlicerMorph Cloud, it will be in /home/docker/sample_data/Mouse_Models

### Step 1. Switch to the ALPCA module in 3D Slicer and choose the Batch Processing tab (red). 
In the `Method` entry (dark blue), open the drop-down menu to select Mu`lti-Template (MALPACA)` option from the dropdown menu.

### Step 2. Select required input and output directories.
* In the “Source model(s)” entry (yellow), select the folder that contains .ply files of the templates. 
  * **If you are uncertain about which specimens to use as templates, you may use the accompanied k-means mult-template selection method (see [kmeans templates selection tutorial](https://github.com/SlicerMorph/Tutorials/blob/main/MALPACA/K-means_templates_selection.md)).**
  * If you have finished the steps in the above tutorial, you can select the dirctory that contains the k-means selected templates. 
* In the “Source landmarks” entry (green), select the folder that contains manual landmark files (fcsv format) for the templates. The names of the template model and landmark files must be identical. 
* In the “Target model directory” entry (dark grey), select the folder that contains .ply files of the target meshes. These are the specimens to be landmarked by MALPCA.
* In the “Target output landmark directory” (light blue), select the folder for MALPACA output.

### Step 3. Click the `Run auto-landmarking` button (red arrow) to execute MALPACA.
Slicer may appear to be in the “no response” condition (Fig. S21). This is because MALPACA is running.

### Step 4. See MALPACA output.
Open the target output landmark directory specified in Step 7 that stores the MALPACA output 
* The `advancedparameters.txt `file stores the MALPACA settings.
* The `individual estimates` folder contains landmarks estimated by each individual template stored in the fcsv format (Fig. S22 and Fig. S23). F

* or each file name, the postfix is the template that generate this estimated landmark file. For example, `129X1_SVJ_B6CBAF1` suggests that the estimated landmarks of the specimen 129X1_SVJ is derived from using the template B6CBAF1.

* The `medianEstimates` folder contains the final output of MALPACA storing in fcsv format (Fig. S22 and Fig. S24). Each landmark file name has a suffix `_median`, suggesting it is the median of the estimates derived from using all templates.
