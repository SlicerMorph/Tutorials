# Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA) Module III

## Exporting data for Analysis in R 
You can get your SlicerMorph data into R in two ways:

1. You can use the SlicerMorphs GPA aligned coordinates directly into your allometric regression model or any other downstream shape analysis.
2. You can use the original landmark coordinates as saved in FCSV or JSON format. 

Provided that you used identical settings across different GPA sofware (e.g., gpagen in geomorph), both options should (and will) give you identical results (within machine precision). You will do an exercise that demonstrate that using one of the sample datasets from SlicerMorph. 

### How to import FCSV and JSON files into R?

FCSV is a very simple file format. You can write your import function simply using the base R **read.csv()** function. For JSON, you will need a JSON parser library. THere are a number of them for R (e.g., jsonlite, rjson etc). We have developed two convinence functions that lets you import fiducial markups generated by Slicer into R, either from FCSV or JSON format. These might eventually turn into a SlicerMorpheR package in R, but for time being please access them through this github repository:
1. [read.markups.fcsv.R](https://github.com/muratmaga/SlicerMorph_Rexamples/blob/main/read.markups.fcsv.R)
2. [read.markups.json.R](https://github.com/muratmaga/SlicerMorph_Rexamples/blob/main/read.markups.json.R)

You can simpy use the **source()** function to call them directly from these repos. For example,

```
source("https://github.com/muratmaga/SlicerMorph_Rexamples/blob/main/read.markups.fcsv.R")
read.markups.fcsv("path_to_file")
```
will report the coordinates saved in the fcsv file as a 2D matrix. Note that both fcsv and json reader functions omit the landmark labels. If this is something important for your analysis, you will want to modify our example code. 

Additionally, we provide another convenience function to parse the log output (**analysis.log** file) from GPA module output. Parser saves everything necessary, including the output files as well as raw coordinates, in a large R object. You can find the function here:

3. [log_parser.R](https://github.com/muratmaga/SlicerMorph_Rexamples/blob/main/log_parser.R)

Specifically, it provides:
  * $input.path = Unix style path to input folder with landmark files.
  * $output.path = Unix stype path to the output folder created by GPA
  * $files = files included in the analysis
  * $format = format of landmark files ("fcsv" or "mrk.json")
  * $no.LM = number of landmarks original
  * $skipped = If any landmark is omitted in GPA (TRUE/FALSE) 
  * $skippedLM = Indices of skipped LMs (created only if $skipped=TRUE)
  * $scale = are data scaled by centroid sizes (TRUE/FALSE)
  * $MeanShape = filename that contains mean shape coordinates calculated by GPA (csv format)
  * $eigenvalues = filename that contains eigenvalues as calculated by PCA in the SlicerMorph GPA (csv format)
  * $eigenvectors = filename that contains eigenvectors as calculated by PCA in the SlicerMorph GPA (csv format)
  * $OutputData = filename that contains procrustes distances, centroid sizes and procrustes aligned coordinates as calculated by the SlicerMorph GPA (csv format)
  * $pcScores = filename that contains individal PC scores of specimens as calculated by PCA in the SlicerMorph GPA (csv format)
  * $ID = list of specimen identifiers
  * $LM = 3D landmark array that contains the 3D raw coordinates as inputed to the SlicerMorph GPA module. 
  
These three functions provide everything you need to get SlicerMorph data into R; regardless if it is raw coordinates, or output from GPA module. 

## Example R analysis
Now, we will go through a R notebook that will use these the parser() function to import data into R and fit a allometric regression model to both raw coordinates as well and GPA aligned procrustes coordinates. To do the next steps in tutorial:

1. Make sure you execute the GPA module in the Gorilla skulls sample dataset, and make a note of the output folder you specified. You will need to enter this into the R.
2. Create a blank RNotebook in the Rstudio in SlicerMorphCloud, Rstudio may want to install some packages, accept and proceeed. 
3. [Copy and paste the contents of this Rnotebook into the blank one you generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muratmaga/SlicerMorph_Rexamples/main/Geomorph_regression.Rmd) 

Continue following the instructions in the R Notebook.
